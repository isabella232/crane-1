# Crane

Crane is a small Spring Boot project used for hosting authenticated R
Repositories. It is designed to be used in combination with RDepot. Because
Crane combines the hosting of directories with authentication and authorization
it can be used for many other use-cases, such as the hosting of documentation or
project assets.
